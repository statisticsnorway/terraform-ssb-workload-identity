# terraform-ssb-workload-identity

This is a Terraform module for creating Google Workload Identity Service Accounts.

## Usage

See [the example module](./examples/main.tf) for an example of setting up workload identity and giving access to a bucket.

**Note:** For the workload identity to work, you have to annotate the Kubernetes service account with the email of the created GCP service account. The email is provided as output from this module. This can be done using the HelmRelease by specifying it in `spec.values`:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  annotations:
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: "wi-test-app-sa-wi@dev-bip.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```
